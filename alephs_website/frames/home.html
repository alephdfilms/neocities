  <h1>Welcome to my website! </h1>
  <p>This website is being hosted through Neocities! Of course, the HTTP:// protocol version (located at aleph.is-local.org) is being hosted elsewhere for browsers like Internet Explorer.</p>
  <!--[if lt IE 7]>
  <p><small>When I said Internet Explorer, I didn't mean anything less than 7. Enjoy the Javascript errors!</small></p>
  <!--[endif]-->
  <!--[if gte IE 7]>
  <p><small>Good job, you're up to date.</small></p>
  <!--[endif]-->
  <p>There are many better websites than mine, but, if you're curious, take a deep dive into this one. Maybe you'll find something neat.</p>
  <p>Oh yeah, if you want to add a link to my site, there's always the button in the footer. :) </p>
  <p><small>I might revamp the site because this is a bit of a mess. :|</small></p>
