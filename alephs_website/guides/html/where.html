    <h1>Where do I get my own website?</h1>
    <p>
    There's a couple of places to get a website for free. Here's a few that I've tried:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.neocities.org">Neocities</a> (www.neocities.org) - The place where this website is hosted now. If you're <em>JUST</em> starting out, then this is the place for you to learn how to make websites. <a href="https://neocities.org/site_files/allowed_types">Doesn't support some file formats though</a>.<br>This is what we'll be using to make our very own website.</li>
    <li><a href="https://pages.github.com">Github Pages</a> (pages.github.com) - If you're viewing this in Safari 2&mdash;or even Internet Explorer&mdash;blame this service. It also supports almost every file format that I can think of, so if you like using Flash files, this is the place.</li>
    <li><a href="https://glitch.com">Glitch</a> (glitch.com) - Where I started off. <a href="https://ndurudiallo.glitch.me/">No, really.</a></li>
    </ul>
		</div>
		<!-- footer! -->
		<div class="footer"> <img src="../../images/blah_guy.svg" height="100%" alt="the blah guy.">
			<span id="buttons"></span> <script type="text/javascript" src="../../js/loadbuttons.js"></script>
		</div>
		<!-- killed. -->
	</div>
	<!-- Die, container! -->
</body>
<!-- That's all! Now, end the html. -->

</html>
